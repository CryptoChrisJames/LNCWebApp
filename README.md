# LNCWebApp
Web application and Class Library for LiveNColor.com, an ecommerce website developed in ASP.Net Core 1.1. 
This application is an e-Commerce Web App that uses Web APIs for the back end for the purpose of creating portability.
When the web app is finished, the system architecture can then be expanded to include mobile and desktop applications with ease. 
~~The front end is a template developed by a third party, with custom Jquery functions for the cart and other interactive purposes.~~ The previous template was removed due to compatibility issues with responsive design. The front end is now being redesigned with the purpose of providing a better user experience for mobile, tablet or PC.
